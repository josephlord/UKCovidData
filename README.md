# UKCovidData

This app started as a personal toy for analysing and seeing the latest English case data by age and area of the country. It was also a personal experiment in some new development technologies.

Feel free to try this out.

## Support

Feel free to raise issues if anything doesn't work correctly or you can think of improvements. I'm unlikely to have much time to work on the app but some things might be possible.

## Future possibilities and directions (PRs welcome)

 - Graphs and visualisations
 - Additional data sets (either expanding area options or adding other data types such as death statistics)
 - Improve onboarding (explain updating, add progress indicator for initial download etc.)
 - Help tips and usage guide.
 - Automatic updating to latest data on launch
 
 This was quick experimental app. The code is not polished and cleaned up, there may be crashes, this was originally written for me but it is now a good enough experience that others may like it too.
